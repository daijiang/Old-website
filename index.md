Welcome! This is the
website of Daijiang Li. I am currently a third-year
PhD student in the *[Department of Botany](http://botany.wisc.edu)*,
*[University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu)*, working with
*[Don Waller](http://www.botany.wisc.edu/waller/index.html)*. I got my
Bachelor degree from *[Yunnan University](http://www.ynu.edu.cn)* at
2008, with Ecology as my major. After then, I completed my Master study
under the direction of Dr. Shaolin Peng, in *[School of Life
Science](http://lifescience.sysu.edu.cn/main/default/welcome.aspx)*,
*[Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2011/)*.

I am interested with "the causes and consequences of biodiversity" in
community ecology, one of the central goals in ecology. In the face of
rapid environmental change worldwide, understanding community assemble
rules, community dynamics, the forces and processes underlying and the
relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning will be
crucial for conserving, managing and restoring the overall biodiversity.
