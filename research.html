  <p><h3>&rsaquo; Community Assembly of Pine Barrens </h3></p>
  <p>Thanks to late John Curtis, we have an extraordinary
legacy of baseline data on plant occurrences of different vegetation types in WI. Systematic re-surveys of these sites can uncover a lot of general community assembly "rules".</p>
  <p>Pine barrens are characterized by sandy, dry, nutrient-poor soils and a sparse pine-oak canopy, forming a distinctive community type. These communities provide a good model for studying community structure, composition, and dynamics as well as the underlying processes that drive these patterns.</p>
  <p>I am going to resurvey about 40 Pine barrens sites surveyed by Brown (1950) and others this summer. Briefly, I will survey all trees and saplings in about 1500 m^2 and understory herbs in 50 1m^2 quadrats per site. In addition, I will measure key environmental conditions (canopy cover / light, disturbance, soil condition, etc.) as well as functional traits for the dominant species (including SLA, height, leaf nitrogen content, leaf toughness, leaf thickness, etc.). I am going to analyze these communities at three levels: taxnomy, functional traits and phylogeny level.</p>
<p>This project has two primary aims: first, to draw general conclusions about how pine barrens plant communities are assembled and structured and how they respond to shifts in internal and external environmental conditions. Second, by expanding our understanding of these pine barrens communities and their dynamics, I hope to generate specific and effective suggestions for conserving pine barrens and other natural habitats in WI. In particular, I hope to explore the particular effects of fire history and landscape conditions in order to learn how to conserve plants, animals and the overall biodiversity better.</p>

<p><h3>&rsaquo; Species Evenness and Litter Decomposition </h3></p>
  <p>The following paragraph is the abstract of my Master's work.</p>
  <p><img src="/assets/figs/vines.jpg" width="502" height="359" align="middle" />Climbing plants are increasing in dominance in the subtropical forests of South China and other areas around the world perhaps in response to shifts in climate and land use. These alter patterns of plant dominance and evenness more often than changes in species richness yet most prior biodiversity - ecosystem function studies have focused on the effects of species richness while holding abundance or biomass constant. Here, we report results from an experiment that tested how patterns of leaf litter evenness affected patterns of litter decomposition using mixtures of plant litter from two different functional groups (climbing plants and trees) in a subtropical forest in Guangdong, China. We found that species composition affected rates of decomposition the most. In addition, the evenness in leaf litter composition affects rates of decomposition, but that these effects depend on which plant functional group is dominant. When climbing plants were dominant, even mixtures decomposed slower  significantly than uneven mixtures. Evenness did not affect rates of decomposition, however, when trees were dominant. Decomposition rates increased in mixtures with higher proportion of climbing plants but there were negative non-additive effects of mixing litter overall. The magnitude of antagonistic effects increased with increasing dominance of climbing plants but decreased with time, suggesting a strong negative feedback between litter proportion of climbing plant and decomposition rates at the initial stage. Thus, shifts in which species is dominant and patterns of community evenness can greatly affect short-term decomposition processes.</p>
